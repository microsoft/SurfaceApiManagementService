## Making API calls and code sample

Authentication to the Surface API Management Service is gated by two security checks:
1. Subscription key
   - This must be passed in the request headers as `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`
   - Subscription key can be retrieved from your user profile, as seen in the previous section.
2. Access token
   - The token must be generated from an Entra application of the tenant that you provided during onboarding.
   - The token scope should be `76bd8628-ca60-441c-9d83-06503cbfd9c5/.default`, where the guid is the app id for Surface API Management Service.
   - For instructions on how to create an Entra application and generate a token, see [Create a Microsoft Entra application and service principal that can access resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal).

Please see [SurfaceApiManagementServiceSample](./src/SurfaceApiManagementServiceSample/Program.cs) for sample code that sets these headers and sends a request.

## Warranty and Coverage API

This API provides warranty information for Intune-enrolled Surface devices. Currently, this data is only available in bulk via CSV export.

This API will only provide information for devices registered to the Intune tenant configured during onboarding. If you have devices across multiple tenants, you will need to register each tenant to the Surface API Management Service.

In order for the data to be available, you must first enroll your tenant for scanning:

> `PUT /api/external/warranty/enrollment`

Once enrolled, it may take up to 5 business days to see your populated data via the `export` API. If you receive a 404 error, please wait and try again in a few days.

After the first scan, our services will refresh your tenant's device information biweekly. Please note that if any devices are added/removed from your tenant or any new warranties are added in between scans, the export data may be out-of-date.

The data available through this API is the same as what is available through the Surface Management Portal.

> `GET /api/external/warranty/export`
>
> Response:
> ```
> {
>    "downloadUrl": "url to csv download",
>    "expiresOn": "date/time the downloadUrl will expire on"
> }
> ```

Finally, if you wish to unenroll your tenant, you can do so via:

> `DEL /api/external/warranty/enrollment`
